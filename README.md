Random Forest Classification Model to determine if a mushroom is edible or poisonous

Imagine going on a hiking trip with your family and seeing button mushrooms. You harvest the mushrooms and some wild herbs to make mushroom soup for dinner. Unfortunately, the mushroom you picked is different from what it seems.  You mistakenly picked the Destroying Angels mushroom, one of the most toxic mushrooms resembling a button mushroom, often results in a fatality.

There are approximately 14,000 varieties of mushrooms in the world. Certain species of mushrooms are highly toxic, and consuming even one mushroom can be fatal. The lethality of mushroom poison can be compared with snake bite toxin. This article lists a few interesting facts about mushrooms and attempts to create a classification model using a Random Forest model to determine if a mushroom is safe for consumption.
